Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- Prefer reliable existing libraries or patterns over reinventing the wheel.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

# Repository instructions

This repository is public under Apache-2.0. Publishing packages or container images requires an explicit request.

Follow [AWiki coding rules](../awiki-harness/rules/ai-coding-rules.md), [verification policy](../awiki-harness/rules/verification-policy.md) and [dependency source rules](../awiki-harness/rules/dependency-sources.md).

## Scope

CIMD/private_key_jwt/client_credentials authorization server, resource verifier and MCP example, plus the standalone PAP 0.3 signed-out hello demo. Current TypeScript implementation belongs under ts/; rust/ is reserved for future work.

The owning implementation plan is in `../awiki-plan/20261104-dsh-shared-agent-identity/modules/`. Follow the current local-signing-only scope. Preserve user changes and other agents' file ownership. Commit messages, code comments, logs and errors use English; planning prose uses Chinese.

Use task-isolated databases, keys, state roots and ports. Record real tests and distinguish unit/fixture evidence from remote or product validation. Never log tokens, full assertions, private keys or credentials. No shared-service restart, remote deployment or public release is implied by module work.
